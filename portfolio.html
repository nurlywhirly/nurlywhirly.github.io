        <h3>Things I do:</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Full Stack Software/Web Development</h4>
            <p>I am currently a software developer at <a href="http://www.tessituranetwork.com/network">Tessitura Network</a>, a nonprofit software company focused on supporting the needs of arts/culture/educational organizations.</p>
            <p>I am only here thanks to the life-changing nonprofit coding bootcamp, <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>, a year-long (and tuition-free!) program aimed at increasing gender diversity in the tech industry.</p>

            <h4>Photography</h4>
            <p>I, like every second person and their mom who at one point had enough money to buy a dSLR camera, have dabbled in photography. Please visit my separate <strong><a href="photography-pages/photography.html">photography portfolio</a></strong> for more.

            <h4>Calligraphy</h4>
            <p>Back when I worked at <strong><a href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</a></strong>, I was lucky enough to be able to participate in their <strong><a href="http://www.reed.edu/gallery/Calligraphy_Initiative.html">Calligraphy Initiative</a></strong>, a free weekly class we lovingly called "Scriptorium" that taught the basics of calligraphy, from Roman Capitals to Uncials to Italics and all sorts of hand cramps in between.</p>
            <p>Some samples of my calligraphy can be seen <strong><a href="calligraphy.html">here</a></strong>.

          <section>
            <h4>Writing</h4>
            <p>Just in case code-writing wasn't enough, I also love fiction writing, both prose and screenplays.</p>
