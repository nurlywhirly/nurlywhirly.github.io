        <h3>Things I do:</h3>
          <section>
            <h5>Software Development</h5>
            <p>I'm currently getting my learn on at <strong><a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a></strong>. For my capstone project, I am working on a website called First Drafters, a place where writers can find writing buddies to <del>be miserable with</del> help each other get through the first draft of their projects.</p>
            <p>I am currently interning at Dell EMC Isilon.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h5>Photography</h5>
            <p>I, like every second person and their mom who at one point had enough money to buy a dSLR camera, have dabbled in photography. Please visit my separate <strong><a href="photography-pages/photography.html">photography portfolio</a></strong> for more.
          </section>

          <section>
            <h5>Calligraphy</h5>
            <p>Back when I worked at <strong><a href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</a></strong>, I was lucky enough to be able to participate in their <strong><a href="http://www.reed.edu/gallery/Calligraphy_Initiative.html">Calligraphy Initiative</a></strong>, a free weekly class we lovingly called "Scriptorium" that taught the basics of calligraphy, from Roman Capitals to Uncials to Italics and all sorts of hand cramps in between.</p>
            <p>Some samples of my calligraphy can be seen <strong><a href="calligraphy.html">here</a></strong>.
          </section>

          <section>
            <h5>Writing</h5>
            <p>Just in case code-writing wasn't enough, I also love fiction writing, both prose and screenplays. If you happen to be a super-competent writing agent who somehow found your way here, first off -- wow, welcome to the depths of the internet but secondly -- I have a completed first novel in a series that I <em>just know</em> (because you're imaginary) is right up your alley and will make us millions of dollars. Please <strong><a href="mailto:nicole.url.4@gmail.com">email me</a></strong> for more information.</p>
