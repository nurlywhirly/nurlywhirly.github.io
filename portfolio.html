        <h3>Things I do:</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Software/Full-Stack Web Development</h4>
            <p>I'm currently getting my learn on at <strong><a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a></strong> and am interning at Dell EMC Isilon with the Strategic Testing and Advance Regressions (STAR) team.</p>
            <p><strong>Some recent examples of my work:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nurlywhirly/foodtruck">San Francisco Food Trucks</a></strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>A python command line program that prints out an alphabetically ordered list of all food trucks (10 at a time) that are open at that moment.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nurlywhirly/mars_rovers">Mars Rovers</a></strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>A ruby command line program that deals with two Mars rovers executing a queue of instructions on a rectangular grid. I utilized breadth-first search to help the rovers detour around obstacles.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong><a href="http://weebay.herokuapp.com/">WeeBay</a></strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>One of the biggest assignments at Ada and our first experience using agile practices in a "large" group. Three classmates and I produced an online store using Ruby on Rails.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Photography</h4>
            <p>I, like every second person and their mom who at one point had enough money to buy a dSLR camera, have dabbled in photography. Please visit my separate <strong><a href="photography-pages/photography.html">photography portfolio</a></strong> for more.
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Calligraphy</h4>
            <p>Back when I worked at <strong><a href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</a></strong>, I was lucky enough to be able to participate in their <strong><a href="http://www.reed.edu/gallery/Calligraphy_Initiative.html">Calligraphy Initiative</a></strong>, a free weekly class we lovingly called "Scriptorium" that taught the basics of calligraphy, from Roman Capitals to Uncials to Italics and all sorts of hand cramps in between.</p>
            <p>Some samples of my calligraphy can be seen <strong><a href="calligraphy.html">here</a></strong>.
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Writing</h4>
            <p>Just in case code-writing wasn't enough, I also love fiction writing, both prose and screenplays.</p>
